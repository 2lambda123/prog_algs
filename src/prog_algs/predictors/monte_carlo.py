class MonteCarlo(Predictor):
    """
    Class for performing model-based prediction using sampling. 

    This class defines logic for performing model-based state prediction using sampling methods. A Predictor is constructed using a PrognosticsModel object, (See Prognostics Model Package). The states are simulated until either a specified time horizon is met, or the threshold is reached for all samples, as defined by the threshold equation. A provided future loading equation is used to compute the inputs to the system at any given time point. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    * model : prog_models.prognostics_model.PrognosticsModel\n
        See: Prognostics Model Package\n
        A prognostics model to be used in prediction
    * options (optional, kwargs): configuration options\n
        Any additional configuration values. See default parameters. Additionally, the following configuration parameters are supported: \n
        * dt : Step size (s)
        * horizon : Prediction horizon (s)
        * save_freq : Frequency at which results are saved (s)
        * save_pts : Any additional savepoints (s) e.g., [10.1, 22.5]
        * cores : Number of cores to use in multithreading
