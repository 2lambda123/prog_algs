"""
This example performs a state estimation and prediction with uncertainty given a Prognostics Model. Unlike basic_example, this example uses a model with multiple events (ThrownObject). Prediction only ends when all events are met
 
Method: An instance of the Thrown Object model in prog_models is created, and the prediction process is achieved in three steps:
    1) State estimation of the current state is performed using a chosen state_estimator, and samples are drawn from this estimate
    2) Prediction of future states (with uncertainty) and the times at which the event thresholds will be reached
Results: 
    i) Predicted future values (inputs, states, outputs, event_states) with uncertainty from prediction
    ii) Time event is predicted to occur (with uncertainty)
