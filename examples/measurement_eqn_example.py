"""
This example performs a state estimation with uncertainty given a Prognostics Model for a system in which not all output values are measured. 
 
Method: An instance of the BatteryCircuit model in prog_models is created. We assume that we are only measuring one of the output values, and we define a measurement_eqn to remove the other output value.  
        Estimation of the current state is performed at various time steps, using the defined state_estimator. The state_estimator takes the measurement_eqn as input, to account for the missing output information. 

Results: 
    i) Estimate of the current state given various times
    ii) Display of results, such as prior and posterior state estimate values and SOC

    # The measurement_eqn can be used for any case where the measurement doesn't match the model outputs
    # For example, when units are different, or when the measurement is some combination of the outputs
