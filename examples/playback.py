"""
This example performs state estimation and prediction using playback data. 
 
Method: An instance of the BatteryCircuit model in prog_models is created, the state estimation is set up by defining a state_estimator, and the prediction method is set up by defining a predictor.
        Prediction is then performed using playback data. For each data point:
        1) The necessary data is extracted (time, current load, output values) and corresponding values defined (t, i, and z)
        2) The current state estimate is performed and samples are drawn from this distribution
        3) Prediction performed to get future states (with uncertainty) and the times at which the event threshold will be reached
Results: 
    i) Predicted future values (inputs, states, outputs, event_states) with uncertainty from prediction
    ii) Time event is predicted to occur (with uncertainty)
    iii) Various prediction metrics
    iv) Figures illustrating results
